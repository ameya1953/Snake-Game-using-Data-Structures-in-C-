# Snake-Game-using-Data-Structures-in-CPP

A simple console-based Snake game developed using C++. This project demonstrates the implementation of fundamental data structures and algorithms in game development.

## Features
- **Dynamic Snake Growth**: Efficient management of snake's length and movement using dynamic arrays/vectors.
- **Collision Detection**: Real-time collision detection with walls and itself.
- **Responsive Input Handling**: Handles user inputs for controlling the snake.

### **Prerequisites**
- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Terminal or Command Prompt
